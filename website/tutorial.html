        <a id="intro"></a><h3>Introduction</h3></a>
        <p>AURtip-tipbot for bland.is is a convenient way to thank people who post helpful comments.
	    Tipping users on bland.is is a good way to encourage people to keep posting, thank them for contributing, and keep the 
	    community alive.  Aurtip can send your balance to any address so you can spend your Auroracoins elsewhere.
	    Include "+AURtip" for reigistration and other commands.</p>
	    <p>The commands are listed and described below in the <a href="#commands">commands section</a>.</p>
        
        <a id="account"></a><h3>Details of an AURtip account</h3>
        <p>When you make your first AURtip command on bland.is (+AURtip), you are automatically registered on our server.
	    Your bland.is username is used for your AURtip account, and you do not need a password.  A deposit public key
	    is assigned to your account for you to deposit funds to begin tipping other users.  When you request information 
	    from AURtip, you can either have that information posted publicly to the bland.is forum, or recieve that information 
	    at your private email address.  To receive it in your email simply associate an email address with your AURtip account
	    by sending it in a command like this:</p>
	    <p><strong>+AURtip email@address.com</strong></p>
	    <p>From this point all your AURtip information will be send privately to your email.  To change your onfile email address
	    simply send us a new one.  Also, to remove your email from our records, send a command like this:</p>
	    <p><strong>+AURtip noemail</strong></p>
        
        <a id="commands"></a><h3>Overview of AURtip commands</h3>
        <p>Here is a list of all the aurtip commands.  To use a command you should type "+AURtip" into your post.  Up to
	    four items can be included in an AURtip command eg. "+AURtip balance tip @username 1".  Descriptions and examples are below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>info</strong> - returns your account info including balance, addresses and preferences.</li>
            <br>
            <p>Usage: <i>+AURtip info</i><p>
            <li><strong>history</strong> - returns all your transaction history including deposits, withdrawls, and tips sent and received.</li>
            <br>
            <p>Usage: <i>+AURtip history</i><p>
            <li><strong>tip</strong> - sends a tip to a user.  This command must include one username and one amount</li>
            <br>
    	    <p>Usage: <i>+AURtip tip @username 1</i> - tip one AUR to bland.is user "username"<p>
            <p>Usage: <i>+AURtip tip 1 @username</i> - same as above<p>
            <p>Usage: <i>+AURtip tip email@address.com 1 @username</i> - change your email and send one AUR to to bland.is user "username"<p>
        </ul>
        
        <a id="deposit"></a><h3>Depositing Auroracoins to your AURtip account</h3>
        <p>To deposit Auroracoins to your AURtip account, send AUR to the Auroracoin deposit address associated with your account.  
            It is safe to show others this address since they cannot use it to spent the money in that address.  To see your address, 
            you cand send the command "+AURtip info" and your deposit address will be included in the reply.</p>
	    <p>After you deposit Auroracoins into your AURtip account, it may take a few minutes for us to receive them.  When your Auroracoins
	    are deposited into your AURtip account and become available we will send you a message to let you know.</p>
        
        <a is="tipping"></a><h3>Sending AURtips</h3>
        <p>The "tip" command is used to send AUR to another bland.is user or you can just include a username and amount.  You can simply include a username with the "@" symbol and an
	    amount.  The funds will be withdrawn from your onfile account balance and a message will be sent to the recipeint.  If the 
	    recipeint does not accept your tip in 5 days, the amount will be returned to your account.  Tips can be sent in conjunction 
	    with other commands as well.  Some example usages are listed below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Usage: <i>+Aurtip @username 1</i> - send "username" 1 AUR</li>
            <li>Usage: <i>+Aurtip 1 @username</i> - same as above</li>
            <li>Usage: <i>+Aurtip tip @username 1</i> - same as above</li>
            <li>Usage: <i>+Aurtip tip @username 1 history</i> - send "username" 1 AUR and send your history to you.</li>
            <li>Usage: <i>+Aurtip tip history @username 1</i> - same as above</li>
        </ul>
        
        <a id="preferences"></a><h3>Seeing and changing AURtip account preferences</h3>
        <p>Your AURtip account has preferences to allow you to automate some of the actions of AURtip.  For example, you can
	    set your account with preferences to automatically accept tips, or to automatically withdraw tips to your Auroracoin address.
	    Below are some exampes of how to set specific preferences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>autowithdraw</i> - automatically withdraws your tips to your onfile Auroracoin receiving address.</li>
            <li><i>noemail</i> - removes your email address from our server.  You cannot receive private messages.</li>
        </ul>
