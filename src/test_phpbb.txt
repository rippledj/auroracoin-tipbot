Hi all,<br /><br /><br />Since I'm responsible for Marketing and promotion of auroracoin, I would like to invite people that live in Iceland to help us out in promoting our coin.

Honestly I didn't think of it before but I'm all for development where both coins can strengthen and support one another, this is not a competition.

Hello Jon,<br /><br />Welcome to the forum.<br /><br />Currently there are a few technical things that need to be sorted out first, before we can get really going. But here are already a few suggestions:<br /><br />1) Be active on the forum (ask questions, get informed, help others solving problems they encounter and provide ideas) and discuss.<br />2) Documentation, some of it will be technical, but also a lot non-technical documentation will be required.<br />3) Translation. The dev team contains a few Icelandic people, but having a few extra people that can help translate interfaces of too-be-written software buts less burden on them, so they can focus on other aspects. Also documentation of Point 2 could use translation.<br />4) Talk with family in Iceland about it, see if they can come up with ideas to use it in their everyday life (also ideas for promotional things later).<br />5) Tell what you're good at and see how you can use that to help (discuss this).<br />6) Timeline at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://auroracoin.is" rel="nofollow" >http://auroracoin.is</a><!-- m --> needs to be caught up with. Sort out missing things and write short articles for it.<br /><br />If there is something specific that you want to help with, let us know.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://auroraspjall.is/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=114">BioMike</a> — 05 May 2015 21:51</p><hr />

Hi everyone. <br /><br />Firstly I want to congratulate the people behind all of this for making AUR a reality. Secondly, I must also express my excitement when I heard that this cryptocurrency was made for Iceland. <br /><br />I'm an Icelander who studies abroad, so I didn't know about this until way too late. I was actually reading about Bitcoin and its potential as an alternate currency to fiat currency when I discovered AuroraCoin, and man did I get excited!<br /><br />My question to all of you is this:<br /><br />How can regular people, with no computer science/technical background help? <br /><br />I really want this project of yours to work and I'm wondering how we can help.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Jón<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://auroraspjall.is/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=180">jonkolbeinn</a> — 05 May 2015 20:18</p><hr />
